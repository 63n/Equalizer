Fix race during object mapping when:

  master processes subscribe req (send map data v X)
  master commits v X+1

  slave cmd receives map data v X
  slave cmd receives map reply (unblock main)
  slave main calls applyMapData
  applyMapData pops v X
  slave cmd receives and drops v X+1 since _version = NONE and
    _queuedVersions empty 

Solve it by:

  never drop received packets
  send map version from master to slave
  drop unfit versions in applyMapData
