Implement run-time window creation:
- Allow creation of Windows, Channels, Views, Layouts, Segments and Canvases
- Compounds and destination Channels are automatically created by the server
- Use EQ_ID_NONE to allow for '0' objects during serialization
- Rework Config::startFrame - finish/sync logics is on server
- Newly created admin entities are created empty on the server,
  registered to assign an identifier, mapped with VERSION_NONE on the
  admin client and then committed to initialize the master version

Unrelated cleanups:
- eqPly: Use config model if no view model is set
- Denoisify Window/Channel viewport updates
- Create Wall ctor with default values for convenience
- Opt: Don't call pack() on commit() if no slaves are listening

Included bugs:
- admin client exit does not work
- creating and committing two windows too fast doesn't work
- Admin entities are not synced and will assert in notifyNewHeadVersion
  eventually
- Entity destruction not yet implemented
