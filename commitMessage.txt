Implement 2509147: Passive stereo swap sync with one pipe

Multiple windows on the same pipe can now join the same software swap
barrier. All windows will execute a finish, but the barrier will only be
executed by the first window. Since all windows have finished before
swapBuffers, the first window will block in the barrier, and all
subsequent windows will swap immediately afterwards since all commands
have been finished already. Each window will flush at the end of a frame
to ensure timely execution of the swap command.

The behaviour of passive stereo on one pipe with hardware swapbarrier
needs to be tested.
