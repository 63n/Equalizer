Cleanup and optimize IDPool

In debug builds we reuse IDs as early as possible to detect potential
errors with ID reusage throughout the framework and applications. In
release build we reuse them as late as possible to be as robust as
possible with any error which might have slipped though.

Replace cache list with vector.
