Compression plugin:
- Fix internal format usage (color buffer always with alpha)
- Re-add depth test to pixel bench
- map V1-style names to default (BGR-order) compressor names
- add sensible speeds for RGBA downloaders - 10_2, 16f and 32f to test
- reorder naming to be easier to correlate to formats

Open Issue: currently select BGR downloader due to data reduction
