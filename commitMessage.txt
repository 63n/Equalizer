Refactor object packet dispatch to behave as expected:
- The receiver thread dispatches the command to the correct instance(s)
- The worker thread dispatches a command to exactly one instance

-> Clone commands as needed
-> Add a new command dispatch id to identify target instance
-> Refactor command cache to track its size simpler
-> Refactor session object dispatch as described
