Untested version of multicast mapping for versioned objects:
- Refactor Object::VERSION_ to standalone enum
- New method MTQueue::front()
- Copy-ctor for ObjectInstanceDataIStream (retains packets)
- Rewrite instance cache, once more
- Implement cache logics:
  o instance data is send via multicast
  o instance data packet is forwarded to object(s) on requestor node
  o slave: announce from..to cached version during mapping
  o master: send missing versions, announce start cached version
  o slave: copy missing versions from cache

Possible application breakage: replace eq::net::Object::VERSION_foo with
eq::net::VERSION_foo
