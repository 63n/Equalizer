Fix longstanding, rare Win32 network bug. The bug was caused by two
interdependent issues:

Issue 1: WaitForMultipleObjects in ConnectionSet::select occasionally
signals data on an empty socket, causing SocketConnection::readSync to
deadlock.
Fix: Do a non-blocking read on the *first byte* of each packet. Reset
ConnectionSet if socket was empty

Issue 2: WSAGetOverlappedResult returns occasionally WSASYSCALLFAILURE,
causing out-of-sync on the TCP stream.
Fix: Retry WSAGetOverlappedResult *after* a small sleep period.
