Ubuntu bugfixes:
- release build warnings and errors
- framerate equalizer assert with too-fast rendering
- eqPly idle aa precision issue

Applications using eq::base::Thread directly need to change the return
value of run(). In case the return value was used previously, it has to
be stored as a member variable of the thread now.
