RSP:
- use new event connection for signalling
- remove intermediate read packet buffers
  o directly dispatch received datagrams to app thread 
  o increase number of packet buffers
- rework acks and sequence id handling
  o in-order packets directly increase connection->_sequenceID
  o out-of-order packets are temporarly stored
  o ack request handling used _sequenceID and current ooo store

Issue: Due to high packet rate on Posix (~70k @ 100MB/s) we are now
limited by the performance of the reader->app queue.
