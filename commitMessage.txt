Refactor glX/X11 event handling and dispatch:
- one event handler per window (as with AGL, WGL)
- GLX message pump holds and polls X11 connections
- event handler registers Display connections
- allow GLXWindow creation without GLXPipey
-> Decouples event handler system pipe and system window implementations
-> Simplifies code significantly

Change base::PerThread, removing deletion callback, deletes object directly.
