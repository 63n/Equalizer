RSP: Implement sliding ack window with early acks
Attn: Not working, check in to enable cross-machine debugging

This optimization removes the implicit ackreq/ack barrier every n
packets by a sliding send window. RSP receivers proactively send acks
every RSP_ACK_FREQUENCY fully packets received. RSP senders check if all
acks have been received when handling an ack, and finish the write queue
up to this sequence. RSP senders only send an ack request if there is no
more data to send or repeat. Sequence IDs are no longer manually reset,
they will automatically wrap when 64k is reached. This facilitates the
'distance' computations for sequences.

Congestion control algorithm is still hard-coded and will be finalized
later when tuning on real hardware.

Get rid of a few unneeded variables.
