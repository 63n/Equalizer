RSP: Move writing to protocol thread, i.e., buffered writes
- Datagram packets are prepared in app thread
  o Data is copied here into packet
  o Blocking happens on 'empty buffer' queue
- Protocol thread writes one packet at a time
  o combines multiple writes (up to _ackFreq)
  o posts empty buffer back to app
- buffers are moved to _appBuffers in listen, to _threadBuffers in accept
  o Listening connections communicate writes from app->thread
  o Connected connections communicate reads from thread->app
- Remove unused timing stats
