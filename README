 This directory is the top-level directory for the Equalizer sources.
 Executing 'make' should build all targets. See also the doc/FAQ.
 Platform-specific READMEs are in doc/. End-User and developer
 documentation can be found on the Equalizer website at
 http://www.equalizergraphics.com/

                           Running Equalizer

 The main example is eqPly, a scalable rendering program for polygonal
 data. Furthermore, there is eqHello, a very simple Equalizer program,
 and eVolve, a scalable volume renderer. To run examples, first setup
 your library search path as prompted at the end of the build
 process. Now start the example: 'build/<os>/bin/eqPly'.

 The default launch mechanism for nodes uses ssh. If your configuration
 contains remote nodes, make sure a passwordless login using ssh is
 possible, or reconfigure the launch command accordingly.

                           Build Environment

 The build environment is using CMake 2.8 or later. Furthermore, flex
 and bison are needed during compilation. More details can be found in
 README.CMake.
