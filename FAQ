Q: I am getting a compile error that the include file uuid/uuid.h can
   not be found.
A: Equalizer uses the libuuid to generate unique node identifiers. 
   Under Linux, this library is often part of the ext2fsprogs. Depending
   on you distribution you have to install ext2fsprogs, libuuid,
   libuuid-dev or uuid-dev.
   Under other Unix operating systems, the uuid library is either a
   separate package, or may be part of DCE, from which it originates.

Q: Debian/Ubuntu: As soon as I am using scalable rendering or a swap
   barrier, one of my nodes crashes.
A: The node's hostname is mapped to a local IP address in /etc/hosts,
   rather than a public one. Using another name for the node in the
   configuration file, e.g., the fully qualified hostname or IP address,
   solves the problem.

Q: OS X: I am using the GLX version , and I've configured a fullscreen
   window, but still see the menu bar and dock. What's the problem?
A: The application is responsible for hiding the menu bar and
   dock. Unfortunately that application is X11.app, not the actual X11
   application. You can change X11 to automatically hide the menu and
   dock using LSUIPresentationMode, see
