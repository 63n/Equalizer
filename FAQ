Q: I am getting a compile error that the include file uuid/uuid.h can
   not be found.
A: Equalizer uses the libuuid to generate unique node identifiers. 
   Under Linux, this library is often part of the ext2fsprogs. Depending
   on you distribution you have to install ext2fsprogs, libuuid,
   libuuid-dev or uuid-dev.
   Under other Unix operating systems, the uuid library is either a
   separate package, or may be part of DCE, from which it originates.


Q: Debian/Ubuntu: As soon as I am using scalable rendering or a swap
   barrier, one of my nodes crashes.
A: The node's hostname is mapped to a local IP address in /etc/hosts,
   rather than a public one. Using another name for the node in the
   configuration file, e.g., the fully qualified hostname or IP address,
   solves the problem.
