Q: I am getting a compile error that the include file uuid/uuid.h can
   not be found.
A: Equalizer uses the libuuid to generate unique node identifiers. 
   Under Linux, this library is often part of the ext2fsprogs. Depending
   on you distribution you have to install ext2fsprogs, libuuid,
   libuuid-dev or uuid-dev.
   Under other Unix operating systems, the uuid library is either a
   separate package, or may be part of DCE, from which it originates.
