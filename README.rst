===============================
Equalizer -- Parallel Rendering
===============================

Equalizer is the standard middleware to create and deploy parallel OpenGL-based
applications. It enables applications to benefit from multiple graphics cards,
processors and computers to scale the rendering performance, visual quality and
display size. An Equalizer application runs unmodified on any visualization
system, from a simple workstation to large scale graphics clusters, multi-GPU
workstations and Virtual Reality installations.

--------
Benefits
--------

* **Increased Performance, Visual Quality and Display Size:** Equalizer contains
  the essence of 10+ years of experience in parallel and scalable rendering,
  easily integrated into your application.

* **Fast Path for Parallel OpenGL Applications:** Equalizer is minimally
  invasive and provides the natural parallel execution model to exploit the
  parallelism of multicore, multi-GPU workstations and graphics clusters.

* **Feature-Rich Framework:** Equalizer contains state-of-the-art scalable
  rendering algorithms, and its open development model ensures constant
  improvement. Equalizer applications are flexible and deployable in many,
  rapidly changing environments.

* **Future-Proof:** An active development community and a liberal open source
  license provide cutting-edge features and ensure the safety of your
  investment.

--------
Features
--------

Applications written using the
`Equalizer framework <http://www.equalizergraphics.com/api.html>` benefit from
the following features:

* **`Flexibility <http://www.equalizergraphics.com/configuration.html>`_:**
  An Equalizer application is configured at run-time, allowing the same
  executable to run optimally on any configuration -- from laptops to large
  scale visualization clusters, driving a single window or a six-sided CAVE
  while using one or multiple graphics cards to render each view.

* **`Large Data Visualization
  <http://www.equalizergraphics.com/scalability.html>`_:**
  An Equalizer application can aggregate the power of multiple processors,
  graphics cards and computers to scale the rendering performance, visual
  quality and display size. This allows virtually any data set to be rendered at
  any resolution at interactive framerates, given sufficient hardware resources.

* **`Support for Virtual Reality
  <http://www.equalizergraphics.com/documents/design/immersive.html>`_:**
  Equalizer applications can run seamlessly in Virtual Reality installations
  using active and passive stereo rendering, as well as head tracking for one or
  multiple observers.

* **Data Distribution:** Equalizer simplifies and optimizes the data
  distribution needed for cluster-based execution. The versioned distributed
  objects offered be Equalizer are optimally suited for interactive rendering of
  dynamic data sets on large-scale visualization clusters.

-------------
Compatibility
-------------

Equalizer is a cross-platform toolkit, available for Linux, Windows XP and Mac
OS X and supports both 32-bit and 64-bit execution.

Equalizer does not interfere with the application's OpenGL rendering code.
Equalizer requires at a minimum OpenGL version 1.1 in order to run, but uses
later OpenGL features and extensions where available.

The Equalizer framework is licensed under the `LGPL open source license
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html>`_, which allows free usage in commercial
and open source projects. Only changes to the framework itself have to be
contributed back to open source.

Consulting, software development service and support are available from
`Eyescale Software GmbH <http://www.eyescale.ch/>`_.

---------------
Project Mission
---------------

Equalizer is an open platform for high-performance visualization:

* **Vendor Independence:** The development is not governed by a single company.
  We work with several industry-leading hardware and software vendors as well as
  research institutions on improving Equalizer.

* **Open Source:** Equalizer uses a liberal license which allows usage in both
  open source and commercial products. The license ensures progress on the core
  framework and protects the ISV's investment in the future.

* **Open Community:** We encourage the usage in custom projects and welcome
  contributions to Equalizer by the community. We contribute our experience in
  parallel rendering back to the OpenGL community.
