 Equalizer is tested with CMake-generated Visual Studio 2008 projects on
 Windows XP and 7. Support for Cygwin is preliminary.
 

                       Multi-Node Configurations

 Multi-node configurations are not straight-forward to set up under
 Windows, due to the lack of a standard remote execution service. The
 following options are possible:

 1) Pre-launching all render clients
 2) Installing a remote execution service
 3) Single-machine, multi-process configs


                    1. Pre-launching render clients

 Start all render clients with the options: '-- --eq-client --eq-listen
 IP:port'. Add the following line to each node in your configuration:
 'connection{ hostname "<IP>" port <port>}'. Start the server, start the
 application. The server will try, hopefully successfully, to contact
 the already-running render clients on the configured IP and port.


                 2. Install a remote execution service
 
 Remote launching has been tested using ssh with the cygwin OpenSSH
 port. The following caveats have been observed:

 o You'll need to add <InstPath>/bin manually to your Path variable
 o Open Computer Management->Services->CYGWIN sshd->Properties->Log On and
   activate 'Allow service to interact with the desktop'
 o Change the node's launch command, and potentially launch command
   quote character, in your config file


                3. Single-machine, multi-process configs

 You can use 'EQ_NODE_SATTR_LAUNCH_COMMAND "%c"' in the config file
 globals as your node launch string. This will directly launch the
 render client executable on the local machine, ignoring any configured
 hostnames.


                               Packaging

 If you want to distribute your applications based on Equalizer, you
 will have to install the "Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable
 Package" on the machines you want to run the application.
