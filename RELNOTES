                        Release Notes for Equalizer 0.4

   Welcome to Equalizer 0.4, a framework for the development and deployment
   of scalable OpenGL applications. The major new feature in Equalizer 0.4 is
   the Programming Guide.

   Equalizer 0.4 is a beta release, and therefore intended as preview and
   evaluation snapshot for application developers and early adopters.

  Features

   Equalizer provides the following major features to facilitate the
   development and deployment of scalable OpenGL applications. A detailed
   feature list can be found on the Equalizer website.

     * Runtime Configurability: An Equalizer application can run on any
       configuration, from laptops to large scale visualization clusters,
       without recompilation. The runtime configuration is externalized from
       the application to a systemwide resource server.
     * Runtime Scalability: An Equalizer application can use multiple CPU's,
       GPU's and computers to scale the rendering performance of a single
       view.
     * Distributed Execution: Equalizer applications can be written to
       support cluster-based execution. The task of distributing the
       application data is facilitated by support for versioned, distributed
       objects.
     * Support for Stereo and Immersive Environments: Equalizer supports both
       active and passive stereo rendering, as well as the head tracking,
       which is required for immersive Virtual Reality installations.

     * Programming Guide
     * Fixed aspect ratio support
     * View configuration using projector layout
     * Much improved polygonal rendering example performance
     * New volume rendering example (beta preview)
     * Support for volume-rendering applications
     * Support for per-node frame synchronization
     * Support for AGL and Carbon on Mac OS X
     * Support for Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard
     * Support for Cygwin on Windows XP
     * Infiniband support for Linux

    Bug Fixes

   Equalizer 0.4 includes various bugfixes over the previous release.

    New Documentation

     * Programming Guide
     * The Equalizer Parallel Rendering Framework, technical report
     * Entwicklung eines parallelen OpenGL Polygon-Renderers, semester thesis
       in German about the new eqPly example
     * Direct Send Compositing for Parallel Sort-Last Rendering presentation
     * Transparency and sort-last (DB) compounds
     * Volume Rendering Example
     * Fixed Aspect Ratio

  Removed Features

   The incomplete support for CGL has been replaced by support for AGL and
   Carbon on Mac OS X. CGL proved not to be useful in conjunction with
   windowing and event handling.

  Supported Platforms

   Equalizer is a cross-platform toolkit, designed to run on any modern
   operating system, including all Unix variants and the Windows operating
   system. A compatibility matrix can be found on the Equalizer website.
   Version 0.4 has been tested on:

    Operating System Support

     * Linux: Ubuntu 6.10 (x64, i386)
     * Windows: XP with Visual Studio 2005 (i386, x64) and Cygwin(i386)
     * Mac OS X: 10.4 (PowerPC, i386) and 10.5 (i386)

    Window System Support

     * X11: Full support for all documented features.
     * WGL: Full support for all documented features.
     * AGL: Full support for all documented features.

  Documentation

   The Programming Guide is part of the Equalizer distribution and can be
   found in doc/Developer/ProgrammingGuide/paper.pdf. Equalizer does not yet
   have an Users Guide. The shipped eqPly example provides a reference for
   developing or porting applications. The Developer Documentation on the
   website provides further design documents for specific features. The
   source code is a last resort for information.

  Support

   Technical questions can be posted to the Developer Mailing List, or
   directly to info@equalizergraphics.com.

   Commercial support, custom software development and porting services are
   available from EyeScale. Please contact info@eyescale.ch for further
   information.
