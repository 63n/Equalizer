                   Release Notes for Equalizer 0.5.5

   Welcome to Equalizer 0.5.5, a framework for the development and deployment
   of parallel, scalable OpenGL applications. Equalizer 0.5.5 introduces
   pixel compounds using 2D kernels and facilitates window system
   integration.

   Equalizer 0.5.5 is a developer release, representing a stable snapshot of
   the development tree after the 0.5 release. Equalizer 0.5.5 can be
   retrieved by updating the subversion trunk to revision 2214 (svn up -r
   2214) or by using:
   svn co
   https://equalizer.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/equalizer/tags/release-0.5.5

  Features

   Equalizer provides the following major features to facilitate the
   development and deployment of scalable OpenGL applications. A detailed
   feature list can be found on the Equalizer website.

     * Runtime Configurability: An Equalizer application can run on any
       configuration, from laptops to large scale visualization clusters,
       without recompilation. The runtime configuration is externalized from
       the application to a systemwide resource server.
     * Runtime Scalability: An Equalizer application can use multiple CPU's,
       GPU's and computers to scale the rendering performance of a single
       view.
     * Distributed Execution: Equalizer applications can be written to
       support cluster-based execution. The task of distributing the
       application data is facilitated by support for versioned, distributed
       objects.
     * Support for Stereo and Immersive Environments: Equalizer supports both
       active and passive stereo rendering, as well as the head tracking,
       which is required for immersive Virtual Reality installations.

   the following:

   0.5.5:

     * 2032631: Nullpointer exception and crash
     * 2032643: process-local server object gets not deleted
     * 2033860: frameDrawFinish called too early and too often

    Documentation

     * Statistics Overlay

  API Changes

   0.5.5:

   The new OSWindow interface moved window system depend functionality from
   the eq::Window to different subclasses of OSWindow. Applications
   integrating with their own windowing code have to implement an OSWindow
   containing all the window system code, and instantiate this OSWindow in
   Window::configInitOSWindow. Please refer to the Programming Guide for a
   detailed description of the Window System Interface.

   The OSWindow interface also caused some cleanups in the event handling.
   Most notably, the classes ChannelEvent and WindowEvent are now unneeded
   and have been removed. The former base class Event is now used in the
   appropriate places.

   0.5.4:

   The eqBase, eqNet and eqServer namespaces have been renamed to eq::base,
   eq::net and eq::server, respectively. Application developers are
   encouraged to make the necessary changes, but can define EQ_USE_DEPRECATED
   if these changes are not feasible.

  Removed Features

   None

   operating system, including all Unix variants and the Windows operating
   system. A compatibility matrix can be found on the Equalizer website.

   Equalizer requires at least OpenGL 1.1, but uses newer OpenGL features
   when available. Version 0.5.0 has been tested on:

    Operating System Support

     * Linux: Ubuntu 6.10 (x64, i386), RHEL4 (x64, i386)
     * Windows: XP with Visual Studio 2005 (i386, x64) and Cygwin (i386)
     * Mac OS X: 10.5 (PowerPC, i386)

    Window System Support

  Documentation

   The Programming Guide is available as a hard-copy (0.5.0 only) and online.
   Equalizer does not yet have an Users Guide. The shipped examples provides
   a reference for developing or porting applications. The Developer
   Documentation on the website provides further design documents for
   specific features. The source code is a last resort for information.

  Support

   Technical questions can be posted to the Developer Mailing List, or
   directly to info@equalizergraphics.com.

   Commercial support, custom software development and porting services are
   available from Eyescale. Please contact info@eyescale.ch for further
   information.
