                    Release Notes for Equalizer 0.5

   Welcome to Equalizer 0.5, a framework for the development and deployment
   of parallel, scalable OpenGL applications. Equalizer 0.5 adds a new
   'pixel' task decomposition mode for fill-rate bound applications such as
   raytracing and volume rendering, and speeds up database (sort-last)
   decompositions significantly.

   Equalizer 0.5 is a beta release, and therefore targeted towards
   application developers and early adopters.

  Features

   Equalizer provides the following major features to facilitate the
   development and deployment of scalable OpenGL applications. A detailed
   feature list can be found on the Equalizer website.

     * Runtime Configurability: An Equalizer application can run on any
       configuration, from laptops to large scale visualization clusters,
       without recompilation. The runtime configuration is externalized from
       the application to a systemwide resource server.
     * Runtime Scalability: An Equalizer application can use multiple CPU's,
       GPU's and computers to scale the rendering performance of a single
       view.
     * Distributed Execution: Equalizer applications can be written to
       support cluster-based execution. The task of distributing the
       application data is facilitated by support for versioned, distributed
       objects.
     * Support for Stereo and Immersive Environments: Equalizer supports both
       active and passive stereo rendering, as well as the head tracking,
       which is required for immersive Virtual Reality installations.

  New in this release

   The following features, bug fixes and documentation changes where
   introduced in this release:

    New Features

     * Pixel compounds to accelerate fill-bound applications
     * GLEW integration for simplified OpenGL extension handling in a
       multi-context environment
     * Improved eVolve volume rendering example
     * Pluggable window initialization
     * Off-screen rendering support using PBuffers
     * Interoperability between Mac OS X and Windows XP (same endianess,
       Linux is untested)

    Performance Improvements

     * Much increased DB (sort-last) assembly performance using a mixture of
       GLSL-based and CPU-based compositing
     * Improved network pixel transfer using parallel image compression
       through OpenMP
     * Pluggable window initialization

    Bug Fixes

   Equalizer 0.5 includes various bugfixes over the previous release,
   including the following:

     * 1831090: Session::mapObject() might deadlock
     * 1839291: Initial window size is too small on Win32
     * 1842242: Bug with exiting examples on linux

    Documentation

   The Programming Guide has been extended to 43 pages. The following
   documentation has been added:

     * PBuffer Support
     * OpenGL Extension Handling
     * Pixel Compounds
     * Event Handling

  Removed Features

  Supported Platforms

   Equalizer is a cross-platform toolkit, designed to run on any modern
   operating system, including all Unix variants and the Windows operating
   system. A compatibility matrix can be found on the Equalizer website.
   Version 0.5 has been tested on:

    Operating System Support

     * Linux: Ubuntu 6.10 (x64, i386), RHEL4 (x64, i386)
     * Windows: XP with Visual Studio 2005 (i386, x64) and Cygwin (i386)
     * Mac OS X: 10.5 (PowerPC, i386)

    Window System Support

     * X11: Full support for all documented features.
     * WGL: Full support for all documented features.
     * AGL: Full support for all documented features.

  Documentation

   The Programming Guide is part of the Equalizer and can be found online.
   Equalizer does not yet have an Users Guide. The shipped eqPly example
   provides a reference for developing or porting applications. The Developer
   Documentation on the website provides further design documents for
   specific features. The source code is a last resort for information.

  Support

   Technical questions can be posted to the Developer Mailing List, or
   directly to info@equalizergraphics.com.

   Commercial support, custom software development and porting services are
   available from EyeScale. Please contact info@eyescale.ch for further
   information.
