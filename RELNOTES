                      Release Notes for Equalizer 0.3 Beta

   Welcome to Equalizer 0.3 beta, a framework for the development and
   deployment of scalable multipipe applications, based on C++ and OpenGL.
   The major new feature in Equalizer 0.3 beta is support for the Windows
   operating system.

   Equalizer 0.3 beta is an beta release, and therefore intended as preview
   and evaluation snapshot for application developers and early adopters.

  Features

   Equalizer provides the following major features to facilitate the
   development and deployment of multipipe applications:

     * Runtime Configurability: An Equalizer application can run on any
       configuration, from laptops to large scale visualization clusters,
       without recompilation. The runtime configuration is externalized from
       the application to a systemwide resource server.
     * Runtime Scalability: An Equalizer application can use multiple CPU's,
       GPU's and computers to scale the rendering performance of a single
       view.
     * Distributed Execution: Equalizer applications can be written to
       support cluster-based execution. The task of distributing the
       application data is facilitated by support for versioned, distributed
       objects.
     * Support for Stereo and Immersive Environments: Equalizer supports both
       active and passive stereo rendering, as well as the head tracking,
       which is required for immersive installations.

  Documentation

   Equalizer does not yet have a formal Users or Programmers Guide. The
   shipped eqPly example provides a reference for developing or porting
   applications. The Developer Documentation on the website provides further
   design documents for specific features. The source code is a last resort
   for information.

  Support

   Technical questions can be posted to the Developer Mailing List, or
   directly to info@equalizergraphics.com.

   Commercial support, feature requests, as well as software development and
   porting services are available. Please contact info@equalizergraphics.com
