Release Notes for Equalizer 0.1.0

   Welcome to Equalizer 0.1.0, a framework for the development and deployment
   of scalable multipipe applications based on C++ and OpenGL.

  Features

   Equalizer 0.1.0 is the first official release of this framework. It is
   intended as an early preview and evaluation snapshot for application
   developers and other interested parties. A detailed feature list can be
   found in the new features section below. The major features of Equalizer
   are:

     * Runtime Configurability: An Equalizer application can run on any
       configuration, from laptops to large scale visualization clusters,
       without recompilation. The runtime configuration is externalized from
       the application to a systemwide resource server.
     * Distributed Execution: Equalizer applications can be written to
       support cluster-based execution. The task of distributing the
       application data is facilitated by support for versioned, distributed
       objects.
     * Support for Stereo and Immersive Environments: Equalizer supports both
       active and passive stereo rendering, as well as the head tracking
       needed for immersive installations.

   shipped eqPly example provides a reference for developing or porting
   applications. The Developer Documentation provides further design
   documents for specific features. The source code is another option for
   further information.
