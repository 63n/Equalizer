                    Release Notes for Equalizer 0.1

   Welcome to Equalizer 0.1, a framework for the development and deployment
   of scalable multipipe applications, based on C++ and OpenGL.

   Equalizer 0.1 is the first official release. It is intended as preview and
   evaluation snapshot for application developers and early adopters.

  Features

   Equalizer provides the following major features to facilitate the
   development and deployment of multipipe applications:

     * Runtime Configurability: An Equalizer application can run on any
       configuration, from laptops to large scale visualization clusters,
       without recompilation. The runtime configuration is externalized from
       the application to a systemwide resource server.
     * Distributed Execution: Equalizer applications can be written to
       support cluster-based execution. The task of distributing the
       application data is facilitated by support for versioned, distributed
       objects.
     * Support for Stereo and Immersive Environments: Equalizer supports both
       active and passive stereo rendering, as well as the head tracking
       needed for immersive installations.

  New in this release

   The following features, bug fixes and documentation changes where
   introduced in this release:

    New Features

     * Support for parallel rendering on distributed memory and shared memory
       systems

  Documentation

   Equalizer does not yet have a formal Users or Programmers Guide. The
   shipped eqPly example provides a reference for developing or porting
   applications. The Developer Documentation on the website provides further
   design documents for specific features. The source code is another source
   of information.
