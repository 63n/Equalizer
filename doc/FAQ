Q: How do I resolve syntax errors between OpenGL headers and GLEW?
A: Try to include first eq/eq.h, then your scene graph or OpenGL
   headers. If that doesn't help, and you don't need GLEW, define
   EQ_IGNORE_GLEW before including Equalizer.

Q: Linux: As soon as I am using scalable rendering or a swap barrier,
   one of my nodes crashes.
A: The node's hostname is mapped to a local IP address in /etc/hosts,
   rather than a public one. Using another name for the node in the
   configuration file, e.g., the fully qualified hostname or IP address,
   solves the problem.

Q: OS X: I am using the GLX version, and I've configured a fullscreen
   window, but still see the menu bar and dock. What's the problem?
A: The application is responsible for hiding the menu bar and
   dock. Unfortunately that application is X11.app, not the actual X11
   application. You can change X11 to automatically hide the menu and
   dock using LSUIPresentationMode, see

Q: When I try to render with multiple nodes, the app node reports "Node
   unreachable, all connections failed to connect", but everything seems
   ok. What's up with this?
A: When initializing a node, the Equalizer server tries to connect to
   the node first, in case it was manually prelaunched. The underlying
   Collage library warns that the connection fails, and the server
   handles this situation by then launching the node process using the
   launch command (default ssh). This is completely normal and not an
   error.
