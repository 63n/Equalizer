This is eqOSG, a minimal example which combines Equalizer with OpenSceneGraph.

It was initially developed by students of the Computer Graphics and Multimedia Systems Group,
University of Siegen, Germany.
eqOSG is loosly based on the eqPly example.

eqOSG is licensed under the LGPL version 2.1 or later, see the LICENSE.LGPLv2.1 file.

CMake is used as the build system, see the COMPILING file for building instructions.

When running eqOSG, you can pass a model file as the first parameter, like this:
 eqOSG --model=/home/tmg/cow.osg
If you don't pass a model or the model can't be loaded, a quad will be rendered instead.

Example data like cow.osg can be found at
http://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/browser/OpenSceneGraph-Data.

This example has camera controls similar to a first person shooter. You can use the
following keys to change the camera position:
  Up Arrow: Move forward
  Down Arrow: Move backward
  Right Arrow: Move to the right
  Left Arrow: Move to the left
  Page Up: Move upwards
  Page Down: Move downwards
Additionally, you can change the camera viewing direction by clicking in the window and
then moving the mouse cursor while holding the left mouse button down.

Have a lot of fun!
