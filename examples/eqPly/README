  This directory contains a simple Equalizer application example, a
  polygonal viewer.


Application Structure

  As any Equalizer application, eqPly consists of the main application
  and the rendering clients. In this simple example, they are both
  contained in the same executable.

 Application Main Loop

  The main application is driving the rendering, that is, it controls
  the execution flow by receiving events from the render nodes, acting
  on these events and by issuing the rendering of new frames. It does
  not execute any rendering code.

 Render Nodes

  The main function executes first eq::init(), which will not return
  when the program is executed as a render client. The Equalizer library
  connects the render client to the server, and receives commands from
  this server. The individual rendering entities --nodes, pipes,
  windows, channels-- are created using the NodeFactory. On these
  entities, various functions, e.g. init, update and exit, are called
  based on the commands received from the server. These callback
  functions typically receive an identifier defined by the application
  to provide contextual information. For example, the node's init
  method receives the identifier of the InitData object, as defined by
  the application. It instanciates the object and loads the polygonal
  model named by the InitData.

 Event Processing

  Equalizer collects events for all windows asynchronously and sends
  them to the application thread, where they are processed at the end of
  the frame by Config::handleEvent. This example implements a trackball,
  move and zoom mouse interaction, as well as some keystroke commands.
